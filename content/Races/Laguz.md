Laguz are a race of people who can shift from human-like forms into animal forms.
There are multiple varieties of Laguz, with each having their own strengths and weaknesses.
They are generally adverse to large civilizations and advancing technologies.
Some varieties are more adept to casting magic than others, but in general the use of magic does not hold the same level of importance as in [[Beorc]] culture.

Choose one of the three Laguz types (Beast, Bird, Dragon), then select the subtype as indicated by each transformation stat block. 
You receive a small increment to your stat values depending on your selection as noted in the first column of each table.

## Transformations
Laguz can transform into the shape of a beast, but unlike D&D 5e's druid shape shifting, you do not simply use a totally different stat block. 
Thematically, a Laguz transformation is an physical ability. You are still yourself, transforming into your animal form, while druids are channeling the form of a creature they've seen through magic.
You have proficiency with any attacks that are a result of your transformed form.

## Beast Laguz
The Beast Laguz are comprised of mostly feline beasts, but also include the canine Wolves. In their human-like form, the beasts generally have tails, ears, and sometimes stripes on their face. Most Beast Laguz originate from [[Gallia]], but the Wolf Laguz were historically isolated to the area now known as eastern [[Hatari]].
- **Age**. Laguz reach adulthood in their late teens and live to around two centuries.
- **Size**. Laguz vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.
- **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Skills**. You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
- **Shapeshift**. As a bonus action, you can shapeshift from your human form into your beast form. This transformation lasts for up to 10 minutes, until you die, or until you revert to your human form as a free action. While shifted, you:
    - cannot cast spells (but may keep concentration)
    - cannot use items or weapons
    - gain the AC, traits and features of your beast form
    You can still speak, benefit from your magic items, and use your other class features or abilities as normal. (ex: second wind, sneak attack with finesse natural weapons, combat arts, etc.).

    - cannot cast spells (but may keep concentration)
    - cannot use items or weapons
