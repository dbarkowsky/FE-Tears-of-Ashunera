Beorc, more commonly known as Humans, are as varied as they are plentiful. Although they lack the physical strength and longer lifespan of [[Laguz]], they are quick to populate and have settled throughout the land. 

Crafty by nature, humans are much more likely to invent, build, and research than the Laguz. They have created cultures, developed magics, and built cities that last for generations far beyond the reach of any single human's memory.
