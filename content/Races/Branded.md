As their name suggests, a Branded is marked with a special brand somewhere on their body. This brand is the result of their [[Beorc]] and [[Laguz]] parentage. Despite the racial mixture, Branded mainly appear like normal Beorc, lacking the chimeric features of the Laguz as well as their ability to transform into an animal form. Branded individuals however retain the Laguz's longer lifespan, but to a limited extent. Branded individuals also tend to have unusual eye and hair
colors for a Beorc.
## Branded Traits
The Branded are similar to humans in many ways, but their mixed blood can manifest in a variety of inexplicable ways.

- **Age**. Branded reach adulthood in their late teens but have decelerated aging compared to a human, allowing them to live up to two centuries long.
- **Size**. Branded vary widely in height and build like humans, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.
- **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Incredible Aptitude**. One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and 2 other ability scores  of your choice increase by 1.
- **Skills**. You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

> [!NOTE] Playing as a Branded
> The Branded are often treated poorly by both of their parent races. The Laguz refer to them as "Parentless" and generally refuse to acknowledge their existence if a Branded individual stands before them. In some cases, Laguz have been known to hunt down the Branded.
>
> The Branded are often referred to as "Half-Breeds" by Beorc, leading to persecution and even execution if their Brand is known. Because they closely resemble Beorc, most Branded tend to live among them, though most live quiet, private lives to hide their decelerated aging.
> 
> The children of a Branded may or may not become a Branded themselves. However, the brand may resurface many generations later in an unwitting descendant even if they have two Beorc parents with no brands.
