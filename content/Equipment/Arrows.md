See this table for a quick reference on material costs when crafting arrows.
These costs are doubled when purchasing arrows from a fletcher.

Crafting arrows requires a DC 10 Wisdom check and proficiency with Woodcarver's Tools.
If using the Crossbow, apply this same crafting mechanism to your crossbow bolts.

- ✓: Retrievable with the same functionality as it was fired with
- O: Retrievable, but reduced to a [[#Standard]] arrow.

## Basic Arrows
### Standard
Standard arrows used with bows.
### Torch
A small bit of oiled cloth wraps the tip of this arrow. When lit, the arrow creates a dim light in a 15 ft. radius. Burns for one hour.
### Net
The head of this arrow is actually a small clay pot containing a spring-loaded silk net. When a creature is hit with this arrow, it is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. 

A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.
### Bleeding
These arrowheads are shaped into a triangular tip and barbed. They are most effective when hunting large game, leaving behind a blood trail.

A creature hit with a bleeding arrow take 1 extra slashing damage. At the end of a creature's turn, it takes 1 slashing damage for each bleeding arrow stuck in its flesh. A creature can use its action to remove all arrows and end the bleeding effect.
### Grease
An alchemist's vial of grease replaces the arrowhead and spreads grease on whatever surface it strikes. This grease *is* flammable.

Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for 1 minute.  

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
### Smoke
A small potion attached to the arrow erupts into a cloud of white smoke upon impact. It fills a sphere with a 10 foot radius with a thick fog cloud. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 5 minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
## Specialized Arrows
### Grappling
This arrow has a claw-like tip that firmly grips its target, and it has a thin but durable rope attached with a length of 100 ft. Together, this device holds up to 300 lbs.
### Stalker
Upon impact, this arrow lodges a small, magical tracker in its target. The archer now knows the location of the target for 24 hours.
### Radiant
Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to non-magical weapons are susceptible to this silvered and blessed ammunition. The damage from these arrows are radiant instead of piercing.
### Lightning
These arrows will unleash a magical attack upon its target instead of attempting to pierce them the traditional way. Upon impact, each creature in a 5 ft. radius of the arrow must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or take 4d4 lightning damage.
### Acid
Fitted with a bottle of acid behind the arrow tip, these arrows are heavy but deadly. A creature hit
with this arrow also takes 2d4 acid damage.
### Fire
These arrows will unleash a magical attack upon its target instead of attempting to pierce them the traditional way. Upon impact, each creature in a 5 ft. radius of the arrow must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or be covered with alchemical flames.

Burning creatures take 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This burning damage increases by 1d4 with each passing turn or with each new coverage of alchemical flames. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are also set aflame.
### Darkness
When this arrow lands, it lets loose an cloud of magical darkness that fills a 10 ft. radius sphere for 1 minute. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. This effect occurs even if the arrow does not hit it's intended target.
### Armour Piercing
These heavy arrows are specially designed to puncture even the heaviest armour. When using these arrows against a target wearing heavy armour, add +2 to attack and damage rolls. The normal and long range of a bow launching this arrow is  decreased to half of the normal range due to its weight.
### Scrying
You look into the foggy glass attached to the tip and your non-dominant eye loses sight for a second before reforming inside the glassy bulb. This effect lasts for a minute and survives the shooting of the arrow.
### Concussive
Fitted with a small explosive, these arrows generate a loud pop on contact that will cause a destabilizing ringing in the ears of its target. Until your next turn, a creature hit with a this arrow has disadvantage on its next melee weapon attack roll or Wisdom saving throw. Deaf creatures are immune to this effect.
## Master Arrows
### Teleportation
Enchanted with a spell similar to the [[Staffs#Rescue Staff|Rescue Staff]], this arrow has the ability to retrieve its shooter. After being fired, the shooter can use their bonus action to teleport to the arrow. This effect is available for 1 minute after its initial firing, after which it becomes a standard arrow.
### Creature
Designed specifically to take down a specific creature group, these arrows are adapted to your needs with your extensive knowledge of hunting various creatures. Choose a creature type from the following list ***when you craft the arrows***:
- Abberation
- Beast
- Celestial
- Construct
- Dragon
- Elemental
- Fey
- Fiend
- Monstrosity
- Ooze
- Plant
- Undead

The damage against your chosen creature is doubled.
### Spell Focus
This arrow acts as a point of casting for any of the shooter's spells. Once fired, you may specify this arrow as the origin of any spell you cast for 1 minute.
### Exploding
A concentrated explosive bomb fitted onto an arrow. Upon shatter, each creature in a 10 ft. radius of the arrow must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). A target takes 4d6 fire + 4d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The normal and long range of a bow launching this arrow is  decreased to half of the normal range due to its weight.
### Freezing
This arrow is enchanted with a freezing trap. Upon impact, it quickly expands into a freezing field that covers a 15 ft. radius. Any creature caught in this field may have attacks made against it with advantage and has its movement speed reduced to 0. The area is difficult terrain.

Trapped creatures may roll a Strength saving throw (DC 15) at the beginning of their turn to try and break free of the ice and regain their movement speed.
### Sleep
A small sack of sleep powder is tied to the end of this arrow. It bursts open on impact, resulting in a cloud of blue smoke in a 10 ft. radius. Any creatures caught in this smoke must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or be rendered unconscious for 1 minute, until they take damage, or until another creature uses their action to wake them.
