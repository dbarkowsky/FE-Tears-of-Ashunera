## Spellcasting
Spending your time studying the subtle art of manipulation and deceit, you have learned to use simple magic to cast spells on the Sorcerer Spell List. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting.
### Cantrips
Immediately gain the cantrips Mage Hand, Minor Illusion, and Prestidigitation.
### Spell Slots
The Trickster table shows how many spell slots you gain at each level to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell ice knife and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast ice knife using either slot.
### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Trickster table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
Additionally, when you gain a level, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature.
You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
- Spell Save DC  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
- Spell attack modifier  =  your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
## Illusory Self
You can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest a number of echoes above your Echo Count (see Trickster table), or until you're incapacitated. 

Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

- As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo's space. You make this choice for each attack.
- When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo's space.
## Lucky Seven
Luck always seems to work in your favour, but sometimes it needs a nudge.
Whenever you roll a D20, treat 7s as if they were natural 20s.
## Trickster's Assistant
Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee attack from an echo’s position.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
## Illusory Troupe
You are no longer limited to creating a single echo of yourself at a time. When you use your bonus action to create echoes, you may create up to your possible Echo Count as referenced in the Trickster table. 
If you already have echoes deployed, these existing echoes poof out of existence in a glittery fashion.
## Disappearing Act
You know how to make an exit: with a bang!
As a bonus action on your turn, you may disappear in a cloud of smoke. This smoke quickly dissipates but grants you invisibility until you take your next action (up to 10 minutes). 
You do not provoke attacks of opportunity while in this state. 
Attacking from this invisibility triggers a sneak attack. 
You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. These uses are restored following a long rest.
## House of Mirrors
As an action, select up to four opponents that you can see within 100 feet.
You create echoes of these opponents in an open space adjacent to them.
These illusions use their stat block, but they only have half HP, cannot use active abilities, and cannot cast spells. For example, an echo would benefit from passive abilities like Extra Attack but not active abilities like Action Surge.
Any weapon damage is based on the base damage die of that weapon without any added bonuses. For example, a [[Weapons#Swords|Lancereaver]] would not get a bonus against lance-wielding opponents. It would only deal 1d6 + the echo's Strength modifier.
This ability may be used once per long rest.
