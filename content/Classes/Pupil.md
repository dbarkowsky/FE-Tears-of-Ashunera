## Tome Proficiency
As a novice magician, you are practiced with magical tomes. As a Pupil, you can attune to tomes and decipher the magic powers inscribed into them to cast basic spells.

There are many types of Tomes, but pupils start their journey with the very basics of Anima magic. There are more powerful Tomes with sophisticated arcane magics within, but they require great mastery of magic to be deciphered and understood. This is represented by a Tome's level
requirements.

All Tomes have a number of charges that they can store as magic to be expelled. A Tome recovers all of it's charges after spending 8 hours in the presence of a resting pupil attuned to it. As an action, a pupil can navigate the magic powers stored within a Tome to activate it's effects, expending charges of the Tome's power in the process.

Your familiarity with tomes allow you to attune to 1 additional anima tome (4 total). Attunement for tomes is separate from other magical items.

> [!NOTE] Attunement
> Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. 
> An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three Magic Items at a time. (DMG p. 136) Attunement

## Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your tome magic and spells, as your magic is fueled by the depth of your knowledge and understanding.

You use your Intelligence whenever a tome or spell effect refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tome effect and when making an ranged spell attack roll with one.

- **Spell Save DC**  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
- **Spell attack modifier**  =  your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
## Ability Score Improvement
When your character reaches the 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
