## Bardic Inspiration
You can inspire others through stirring words, music, or dance.
As a Bonus action, you can choose one willing creature that can hear you within 60 feet of you and give one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to that creature.
See the chart above for the size of Bardic Inspiration Dice you have at each level. You have a number of Bardic Inspiration Dice equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
A creature who has been given a Bardic Inspiration die can expend it to roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the
DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time, and loses it after 10 minutes if it is not used.
## Spellcasting
Through your travels as a performer, you have learned to use the magical powers of poetry, song, and dance to cast spells on the Bard Spell List. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting.
### Spell Slots
The dancer table shows how many spell slots you gain at each level to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell healing word and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast healing word using either slot.
### Spells Known
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Dancer table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Additionally, when you gain a level, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since your magic draws on the power of your performance.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
- Spell Save DC  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
- Spell attack modifier  =  your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
## Revitalizing Dance
Your dance has such revitalizing powers that they can push your allies beyond their limit.
As a bonus action, you can expend two of your Bardic Inspiration dice to allow an willing creature within 30 feet of you that can see you to take one additional bonus action on their next turn.
Alternatively, you can expend three of your Bardic Inspiration dice to allow that creature to take one additional action on their next turn instead.
The target creature receives only one Bardic Inspiration die in either case.
## Enthralling Performance
Your performance can seduce and enthrall an audience.
If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. 
While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.
If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
## Inspiring Presence
Even the shortest of your performances can inspire your allies to do their best in the face of challenges.
Whenever a friendly creature within 60 feet of you must make a saving throw, you may use your reaction to cheer them on. That creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier.
## Special Dance
The revitalizing powers of your dance is so striking that it never fails to delight.
The first time each day you target a creature with your Revitalizing Dance feature, you may expend one 1 less Bardic Inspiration die for the feature's effects.
## Restorative Presence
Just being in your vicinity gives your allies a revitalizing boost.
Any allied creature within 5 feet at the start of your turn regains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency.
