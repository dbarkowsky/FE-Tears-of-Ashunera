## Combat Arts
Unlike soldiers who are drilled to fight in a unit or fighters who rely physical Strength, those who discipline themselves to the mastery of weapons are able to learn special skills and techniques known as Combat Arts.
The arts you can learn are listed in the [[#Mercenary Combat Arts]] section at the end of this class's section. The Arts Known column of your class table shows you how many Combat Arts you can learn in total. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one Combat Art you know with a different
one that you are able to learn.
You cannot use more than one Combat Art on the same attack. For example, if you use an Art that activates when you make a weapon attack roll, you cannot also use a second Art that activates when you hit with that attack.
### Arts Dice
Characters who use Combat Arts have Arts Dice, which are d8s. Combat Arts require Art Dice to use, and Arts Dice are expended once used. You regain all of your expended Arts Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
The Arts Dice column of your class table shows when you gain more Arts Dice. Each Combat Art specifies how many Arts Dice it uses.
### Combat Arts Save DC
You can use your Strength modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Art.
- Combat Arts Save DC  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier
## Hired Arms
When you enter a new town, you can spend an hour to ask around for any available mercenary jobs. If there are any, either you'll learn about them, or you'll attract someone who would be interested in hiring your muscle.
## Armsthrift
As a mercenary, you learn the crucial skill of properly maintaining the tools of your trade.
You can repair broken weapons or armor after spending an hour purchasing and working materials. The cost of repairing a weapon or piece of armor is equal to half of it's normal cost.
## Good Fortune
As long as you are paid to do a job, your motivation to live through any dangers it may require is
doubled, and you feel reinvigorated anytime you perform something with great success.
Any time you roll a natural 20 on an attack, saving throw, or ability check, you gain 10 temporary hit points.
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Ability Score Improvement
You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
## Arms Shield
Your training with weapons of all types has given you insight on how to best defend against each.
You gain a +2 bonus to your AC when using a sword against creatures wielding axes, using an axe against creatures wielding lances, or using a lance against creatures wielding swords.
## Strong Riposte
You learn to leverage your opponent's openings to make devastating counter attacks. Whenever a creature makes an attack against you, you gain a +5 bonus to attack and damage rolls against that creature until the start of its next turn.

### Provoke
As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 arts die to target 1 creature per arts die expended that can see or hear you within 30 feet. Those creatures must move towards you or select you as the target of their attacks until the start of your next turn. Roll the expended arts dice and gain  temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.

If the target slams into a hard surface and this movement is ended prematurely, the target takes additional force damage equal to your expended arts die.
### Sunder
When you make a melee weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one arts die to make the attack score a critical hit on three more roll results. For example, on a 17, 18, 19, or 20 instead of just 20. If the attack scores a critical hit, add the expended arts die to the attack's damage roll. This effect stacks with other similar effects.
