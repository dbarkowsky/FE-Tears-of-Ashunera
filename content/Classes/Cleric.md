## Staff Proficiency
You are practiced with magical Staffs and the art of healing. As a healer, you can attune to Staffs and channel the magic powers inscribed into them. There are many types of Staffs, but the vast majority of them have complex magics and can only be used by experienced healers, which are represented by it's level requirements.

All Staffs have a number of charges that they can store to channel their magic. A Staff recovers all of it's charges after spending 8 hours in the presence of a resting healer attuned to it. As an action, a healer can channel the power stored within a Staff to activate it's effects, expending charges of the Staff's power in the process.

Your familiarity with staffs allow you to attune to 1 additional staff (4 total). Attunement to staffs is separate from other magical items.

> [!NOTE] Attunement
> Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. 
> An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three Magic Items at a time. (DMG p. 136) Attunement

## Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your staff magic and spells, as you draw your power from instinct rather than study.

You use your Wisdom whenever a staff or spell effect refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a staff effect and when making an ranged spell attack roll with one.

- **Spell Save DC**  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
- **Spell attack modifier**  =  your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
## Ability Score Improvement
When your character reaches the 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
