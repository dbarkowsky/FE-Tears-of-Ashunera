> [!NOTE] Controlling a Mount
> You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It can act either before or after you.
> 
> It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it, given that it has not already acted that turn.
> PHB, pg. 198

> [!NOTE] Mounting and Dismounting
> Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.
> 
> If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
> 
> If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
> PHB, pg. 198

## Graceful Rider
You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.
Additionally, your mount has advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling prone.
## Spellcasting
Your spellcasting may come from one of two schools depending on your previous class.
If you were a [[Pupil]], you use [[Tomes#Anima Tomes|Anima Tomes]] and the Wizard spell list.
If you were a [[Cleric]], you use [[Tomes#Light Tomes|Light Tomes]] and the Cleric spell list.
### Cantrips
You know two cantrips from your spell list (Wizard/Cleric).
### Spells Known (Pupil Origin)
**This section only applies if you are using the Wizard spell list.** 
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Troubadour table shows when you learn more wizard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
Additionally, when you gain a level, you can choose one of the wizard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
### Preparing Spells (Cleric Origin)
**This section only applies if you are using the Cleric spell list.** 
You are able to cast any spell from the Cleric Spell List.
However, you can only prepare a certain number of spells to be accessible to you at any given time. You may prepare a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your level.
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
### Spell Slots
The Troubadour table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
## Dampen Elements
When a creature within 60 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can
use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.
Additionally, your mount gains resistance to these types of damage while you are riding it.
## Live to Serve
You learn to attune your healing magic to yourself and your mount at all times.
Whenever you use a staff or spell to restore hit points to a creature other than yourself, you regain the same amount of hit points.
## Staff Mastery
Your mastery of magical staffs allow you to attune to 3 additional magic items as long as they are staffs.
## Tome Ward
Your study of magic has taught you how to counter those who would use it for destruction or harm.
While you are mounted, you can give yourself and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you advantage on a saving throw against a single spell or other magical effect. If the effect would deal half damage on a successful save, it instead deals no damage, and only half damage on a failed save.
Additionally, while you are mounted, you can force an spell attack made against you or a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to be made with disadvantage.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
## Beacon of Light
You can use your action to activate an beacon of sunlight from your staff that lasts for 1 minute or
until you dismiss it using another action. This ability requires concentration and follows standard concentration rules for spellcasting.
You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage. Additionally, creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on all attacks against you.
You may use this ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier.
