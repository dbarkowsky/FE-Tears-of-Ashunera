> [!NOTE] Controlling a Mount
> You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It can act either before or after you.
> 
> It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it, given that it has not already acted that turn.
> PHB, pg. 198

> [!NOTE] Mounting and Dismounting
> Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.
> 
> If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
> 
> If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
> PHB, pg. 198

## Courser
Having shown a natural affinity with horses and mounted combat, you have been given a Courser as your companion. Taking care of it is your responsibility and duty. Should your Courser die, you will need to spend 800 gp to purchase and outfit a replacement.
## Skilled Rider
You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if youâ€™re not incapacitated.
Additionally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
## Outdoor Fighter
You excel at fighting in the outdoors with plenty of open space, allowing you to run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. 
If you move at least 20 feet straight towards a creature and then hit it with a weapon attack on the same turn, the creature takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage.
## Canto
Your command of your mount grants you the ability to easily reposition yourself on the battlefield.
After you've taken your action, you can use your reaction to grant your mount an additional 30 foot of movement. A creature that you or your mount have dealt damage to on your turn has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you and your mount until the end of your turn.
## Rescue
You learn to efficiently rescue allies by bringing them atop your mount. When you or a willing creature move within 5 feet of each other, you can use your reaction to pull them atop of your mount. The target creature must be a size smaller than your mount, and you cannot have more than 1 creature with you on your mount at a time.
A rescued creature can spend half of their movement to dismount, or you may use an action to safely dismount them within 5 feet of your mount. You can force an attack targeted at the rescued creature to target you instead.
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Attack Command
You learn to command and ride your mount expertly, allowing them to take the attack action on their turn without knocking you off.
## Desperation
Your bond with your mount allows you to follow each other's attacks effortlessly.
After your mount hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a single melee weapon attack against the same creature.
