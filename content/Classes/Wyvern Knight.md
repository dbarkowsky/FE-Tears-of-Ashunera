## Wyvern
Your wyvern has grown into its full adult form. Taking care of it is your responsibility and duty. Should your wyvern die, you will need to spend 3500 gp to purchase and outfit a replacement.
## Tantivy
You learn to take advantage to open space while fighting atop a wyvern.
If there is only 1 other creature within 15 feet of you and your mount, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack rolls against that creature.
## Axefaire
You become an expert with using Axes.
When using [[Weapons#Axes|Axes]], you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls. This bonus doubles against creatures wielding lances.
## Wyvern's Breath
You learn to command your wyvern to attack your foes with it's breath attack.
As an action, you may command your wyvern to exhale a powerful flaming breath attack in a 15 foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
## Lunge
You learn use the momentum of your attacks to fling your targets around.
When you hit an creature that is your size or smaller with a weapon attack, it must succeed a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be pushed up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. 
## Seal Defense
Your strikes are empowered by the dragon gods themselves. When you or your mount hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, the power of your blow renders the target's reflexes to dust. The target creature suffers a -1 penalty to their AC until the start of your next
turn. This effect can stack.
