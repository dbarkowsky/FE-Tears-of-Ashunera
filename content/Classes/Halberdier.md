## Combat Arts
You have risen above the common ranks and dedicated yourself to the mastery of combat, allowing you to learn special skills and techniques known as Combat Arts.
The arts you can learn are listed in the "Halberdier Combat Arts" section at the end of this class's section. The Arts Known column of your class table shows you how many Combat Arts you can learn in total. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one Combat Art you know with a different
one that you are able to learn.
You cannot use more than one Combat Art on the same attack. For example, if you use an Art that activates when you make a weapon attack roll, you cannot also use a second Art that activates when you hit with that attack.
### Arts Dice
Characters who use Combat Arts have Arts Dice, which are d8s. Combat Arts require Art Dice to use, and Arts Dice are expended once used. You regain all of your expended Arts Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
The Arts Dice column of your class table shows when you gain more Arts Dice. Each Combat Art specifies how many Arts Dice it uses.
### Combat Arts Save DC
You can use your Strength modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Art.
**Combat Arts Save DC**  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier
## Lancefaire
You become an expert with using Lances.
When using lances, spears, or similar weapons with a polearm, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls. This bonus doubles against creatures wielding swords.
## Pincer Attack
Your experience of fighting in military formations has taught you how to take maximum advantage of flanking maneuvers.
When a target creature that you can see within your reach is attacked by another creature on the opposite side of the target from you, you may use your reaction to make an attack against the target creature.
## Rend Heaven
Your use of Combat Arts have culminated in the development of your ultimate finishing skill.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
## Ability Score Improvement
Because of your dedication to bettering yourself, you see noticeable gains in your abilities and skills. You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. A feat may also be taken in place of this improvement.
## Military Legend
Your effectiveness on the battlefield has spread your name far and wide as the exemplary of soldiers.
Soldiers and Militia will recognize your face or at least have heard of your name and deeds. You will always be treated favorably by those in service of the same kingdom or empire as you unless you give them a reason to be hostile. 
Additionally, military armories will usually offer you a generous discount of 25%.
## Impale
The legends of your skill have gained you the favor of the dragon gods themselves.
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, the target creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or the damage from the hit is quadrupled.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
