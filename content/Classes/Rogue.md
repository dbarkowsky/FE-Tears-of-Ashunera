## Thieves’ Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
## Sneak Attack
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal extra damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
The amount of extra damage is show in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table, and increases as you gain levels in this class.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
## Pass
You can enter and leave a hostile creature’s space without treating their space as difficult terrain. If a hostile creature has at least one other creature hostile to it within 5 feet, it cannot make an attack of opportunity against you.
## Stealth
You master the ability to remain unnoticed, even during a fight. If a creature has multiple creatures hostile to it that it can see, including you, it will always always pick another creature as the target of it's attacks instead of you.
This effect ends once you have directly harmed the creature in any way, but resets if the creature loses sight of you. 
## Roguish Style
You adopt a particular style of criminal antics as your specialty. Depending on the kind of work you specialize in, choose one of the following styles to learn:
### Slippery
The best way to survive a fight is to never get caught. You learn to become very difficult to pin down during a fight. When an creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
### Poison
With the proper poison, even the strongest of foes become easy pickings, which is why you start each day preparing a vial of crude poison with whatever is on hand. It'll only remain fresh for the day, but it's more than enough to keep enemies down.
You gain proficiency with the poisoner's kit. As an action, you can apply a vial of crude poison on 2 light slashing or piercing weapons. It remains potent for 1 minute or until it is wiped off. On hit, a creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or become poisoned until the end of it's next turn.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
### Intrigue
You don't have to worry about surviving a fight if you never get into one. You learn to unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1
minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language. If you spend at least 10 minutes listening to someone, you can mimic their voice almost perfectly.
You also gain proficiency with the disguise kit. After spending an appropriate amount of time, you can create anything from a simple to elaborate disguise to alter your appearance, even to mimic the face of a someone you are familiar with.
A creature with passive perception less than 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier will have no reason to suspect your appearance. Otherwise, a suspicious creature can discern that you are disguised with a contested Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Performance
(Charisma) check.
## Evasion
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
## Expertise
Choose two more of your skill proficiencies to gain expertise with. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
## Reliable Talents
You have refined your chosen skills to the point of perfection, allowing you avoid any unlikely mistakes.
Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
