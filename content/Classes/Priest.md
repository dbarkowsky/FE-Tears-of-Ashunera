## Healtouch
You have dedicated yourself to studying the inner workings of healing magic. Whenever you use a staff or spell to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to twice your Intelligence modifier.
## Spellcasting
You have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells on the Cleric Spell List. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting.
### Cantrips
You know four cantrips of your choice from the Cleric Cantrip List.
### Preparing Spells
You are able to cast any spell from the Cleric Spell List.
However, you can only prepare a certain number of spells to be accessible to you at any given time. You may prepare a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your level.
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
### Spell Slots
The Priest table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
### Tome Proficiency
You are practiced with Light tomes.
As a Priest, you can attune to tomes and decipher the magic powers inscribed into them to cast basic spells.
There are many types of tomes, but Priests start their journey with the very basics of Light magic. There are more powerful tomes with sophisticated divine magics within, but they require great mastery of magic to be deciphered and understood. This is represented by a tome's level requirements.
All tomes have a number of charges that they can store as magic to be expelled. A tome recovers all of it's charges after spending 8 hours in the presence of the caster attuned to it. As an action, a caster can navigate the magic powers stored within a tome to activate it's effects, expending charges of the tome's power in the process.
Tomes must be attuned to, and this number is separate from a character's general attunement limit. See the Tome Attunements column in the Priest table for the number of tomes you can be attuned to at once.
## Voice of Reason
Your experience as a healer allows others to easily understand your compassion. You may add your
Intelligence modifier to your persuasion checks.
## Miracle
You are protected by the goddesses blessing, granting you protection from death. The first time you would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.
Alternatively, if you are subjected to an effect that would kill you instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
## Warding Light
Your mastery of staff magic has taught you how to quickly expend the charges of a staff for self defense.
When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can expend 1 charge of a staff you are wielding as a reaction to discharge a bright flare of light in front of your attack, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll.
An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.
## Extended Staff Range
Your knowledge of how to channel the divine power through your staff leads you to doing so with greater strength. You may utilize staffs at double their specified range.
## Staff Mastery
Your study of staff magics allow you to channel their effects much more quickly.
You can activate a staff's magic as a bonus action if the staff's Casting Time is normally 1 Action and it's Duration is Instantaneous. However, this requires you to expend twice the amount of charges as normal. 
You may also attune to one additional staff.
## Divine Intervention
You can call on the goddess to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring the goddess's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your level + your Charisma modifier, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention, such as the effect of a powerful spell or something more specific to the situation.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
