## Inspiration
Your presence on the battlefield inspires all close enough to bask in your divine light.
Any allied creature within 10 feet of you gains +2 to their attack and damage rolls.
## Rally Spectrum
Your bonds with your allies grant you the ability to bring out their maximum potential.
As a bonus action, choose an willing creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Until your next turn, the target creature gains a bonus to their AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws equal to your wisdom modifier. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
At 18th level, you no longer need to rest between uses of this feature.
## Miracle of Dahna
The Valkyrie's divine connection allows them to save a life in a time of crisis.
Once every 10 days, you may revive a creature whose time has come too soon.
This ability takes 10 minutes to complete, upon which the creature is restored to fully health without any previous ailments.
The creature must have been dead for no more than 24 hours.
## Solidarity
Your tactical prowess presence boosts the confidence and focus of those around you.
While you are conscious, friendly creatures within 15 feet of you canâ€™t be frightened and their weapon attacks score a critical hit on one more roll result. For example, on a 19 or 20 instead of just 20. This effect stacks with other similar effects.
## Beacon of Light (2)
Your grace is immaculate, your internal light divine. Those undeserving of your light are punished simply for being.
When you cast Beacon of Light, enemy creatures in the bright light (60-foot radius) take an additional 2d8 of radiant damage at the beginning of your turn. This effect continues for as long as Beacon of Light is active.
