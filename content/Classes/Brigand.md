## Brigand Crafting
You've learned to craft basic necessities in order to survive. Though crude, they can often make the difference between life and death when living without the luxuries of civilization. These items have little to no value to others. 

If you have the required supplies, you can attempt to craft the following items after spending 30 minutes gathering, purchasing, and working components. On a failure, all of the materials are wasted. Each day, this crafting can be attempted a number of times equal to your proficiency.

> [!NOTE] **Crude Poultice**
> - **Difficulty**: DC 10 Wisdom check with Herbalism Kit (DC 15 otherwise)
> - **Weight**: 1lb
> - **Ingredients**: Roots, leaves, or other vegetation
> 
> As an action, you can spread the Crude Poultice to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. After 5 minutes, a stabilized creature with 0 hit points restores 1d4 + 1 HP.

> [!NOTE] Strong Brew
> - **Difficulty**: DC 10 Wisdom Check with Brewer's Supplies (DC 15 otherwise)
> - **Weight**: 5lbs
> - **Ingredients**: Fruit, grain, or potatoes
> 
> Crafting this item creates a potion that grants 10 temporary HP for the next hour. There is enough liquid for four creatures to drink.
 
> [!NOTE] Brigand Axe
> - **Difficulty**: DC 10 Wisdom Check with Smith's Tools (DC 15 otherwise)
> - **Weight**: 12lbs
> - **Ingredients**: Rocks, sticks, or any material that could be combined into a weapon
> 
> An improvised but brutal weapon. Heavy and imbalanced, it's used only by those without alternatives. When landing a critical hit, the Brigand Axe deals an additional 5 Bludgeoning damage. On both a Critical Hit and a Critical Miss, the Brigand Axe is immediately destroyed.
> 
> **Damage**: 1d8 bludgeoning
> **Properties**: Heavy, Versatile (1d10)

## Brigand Defenses
Unable to afford proper fighting gear, you adapt to fight without armor, relying only on your natural resilience and honed physique.

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Strength modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. You do not gain this benefit if you are shapeshifted.
## Familiar Territory
Your past experiences have adapted you to fighting on a particular terrain. Pick one of the options below as your preferred environment.
### Mountain Fighter
Your youth was spent scaling the tallest, most ragged cliffs around. Difficult terrain does not impede your movement, and, while not wearing heavy armour, your climbing speed is equal to your walking speed.
### Grasslands Fighter
Your time spent on the open plains has given you the opportunity to run for miles unobstructed. While you aren't wearing heavy armour, your speed is increased by 10 feet.
### Woodland Fighter
Long years of hunting and fighting in the forest has taught you how to step gracefully, even in the driest of brambles. You are considered proficient in Stealth while not wearing heavy armour.
### Marine Fighter
From your months spent at sea, whether for nefarious purposes or not, you have gained an aptitude for swimming. While not wearing heavy armor, your swim speed it equal to your walking speed.
## Savage Blow
When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack savagely. 
Doing so gives you the following: 
- advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn
- resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage 
- attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn
## Brigand Style
You adopt a particular style fighting for your banditry. Depending on your needs as a brigand, choose one of the following styles to learn:
### Crafty Fighter
You become skilled at constructing traps in order to ambush prey. It only takes you 10 minutes to create a pitfall, rope trap, or various other ambush devices to catch unsuspecting prey off guard. The number of creatures your trap can affect is equal to 2 for every 10 minutes you spend constructing the trap (maximum 12 after 1 hour).

When a creature approaches your trap, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or stumble into your contraption. A creature caught in your trap is Restrained.

A creature restrained this way can spend it's action to break free by passing a Strength throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). An unrestrained creature can use its action to free another creature within its reach from your trap.
### Vengeful Fighter
You fight with a fury few can match, fueled by your deeply seeded hatred that only you know. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack while attacking recklessly, you can focus your rage to deal extra damage equal to 1d8 + half your level. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
### Wary Fighter
You do your best work at night, prowling the shadows to stalk prey and escape dangers. Your familiarity with the night has given you an intuitive understanding of a few magic spells.

As an action, you can cast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without providing material components. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Intimidating Presence
Your menacing glare is so powerful that you can use it to instill absolute terror in others.

As an action, choose a number of creatures equal to half your level (rounded up) that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature(s) can see and hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or be frightened of you. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you canâ€™t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
## Second Wind (2)
You can use your second wind feature twice before need to take a rest.
## Survival of the Fittest
Your physique is par to none and can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.
