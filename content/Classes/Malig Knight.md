## Class Gains
- **Gear**: A [[Weapons#Axes|Steel Axe]] and a 7th-level Tome
- **Weapon Proficiencies:** Axes, one Tome type (from [[Sky Knight]] only)
- **Armour Proficiencies**: Medium Armour
- **Skill Proficiencies**: Choose one from Arcana, History, Investigation, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Persuasion
## Mount
This class has the option of three different mounts:
- Dark Pegasus
- Slender Wyvern
- Shadow Horse

You may choose any one mount when you enter this class.
If you have an existing mount, it replaces that mount. It is recommended you select a mount that reflects the growth of your current mount, but it is not required.
See the bottom of the page for their stat blocks.

> [!NOTE] Controlling a Mount
> You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It can act either before or after you.
> 
> It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it, given that it has not already acted that turn.
> PHB, pg. 198

> [!NOTE] Mounting and Dismounting
> Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.
> 
> If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
> 
> If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
> PHB, pg. 198

> [!NOTE] Flying Mounts
> Flying mounts behave the same as regular mounts, but the following rules should be remembered during play:
> 
> If you fall off your mount, or if your mount becomes incapacitated, you will fall towards the ground at a rate of 500 feet per round. If it is not your turn, you will fall 500 feet before the start of your turn.
>
> Alternatively, if you jump off of your mount on your turn, you will fall 500 feet by the end of your turn. This rapid descent can only be interrupted by a reaction (such as the Feather Fall spell.)
> XGE, pg. 77
>
>At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.
>PHB, pg. 183
## Spellcasting
If you have promoted from the [[Dark Mage]] or [[Troubadour]] classes, continue to use the spell list and Tome type that was gained in that class. You will follow the Malig Knight table [[#From Dark Mage or Troubadour]].

If you have promoted from the [[Sky Knight]] class. See the following sections on how your spellcasting works and follow the [[#From Sky Knight]] table. 
### Choosing a Magic Type
Coming from a class with no magic, you have the option to select a magic type from one of the following options:

- [[Tomes#Dark Tomes|Dark Tomes]] and the Wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier.
- [[Tomes#Anima Tomes|Anima Tomes]] and the Wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier.
- [[Tomes#Light Tomes|Light Tomes]] and the Cleric spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting modifier.

A set number of Tomes can be attuned to at one time, but these attunement slots are separate from those used for other magical items.
You begin this class with three (3) Tome Attunement slots if you currently have none.

- **Spell Save DC**  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting modifier
- **Spell attack modifier**  =  your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting modifier
### Cantrips
Choose three cantrips from your chosen spell list (Wizard/Cleric).
### Spells Known (Wizard Spell List)
**This section only applies if you are using the Wizard spell list.** 
The Spells Known column of the Malig Knight table shows when you learn more wizard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
Additionally, when you gain a level, you can choose one of the wizard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
### Preparing Spells (Cleric Spell List)
**This section only applies if you are using the Cleric spell list.** 
You are able to cast any spell from the Cleric Spell List.
However, you can only prepare a certain number of spells to be accessible to you at any given time. You may prepare a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your level.
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
### Spell Slots
The Malig Knight table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
## Quick Burn
You enter combat with  a fiery passion, but it slowly cools as you become disinterested with the whole event.
When combat begins, you start with a +5 bonus to any attack roll. 
Each turn that passes, that bonus becomes one less until exhausted.
For example, on the first turn your bonus is +5, but by the fourth turn, your bonus is only +2.
## Galeforce
Your control of the skies synergizes with your manipulation of passing souls.
When you attack an opponent on your turn and that attack results in its death, gain an additional movement and action that you must use on the same turn.
This effect can only apply once per turn.
## Dark Tomefaire
Your study of ancient Tomes has revealed a method of channeling life force in exchange for power.
When attacking using a tome, you may also target yourself or a willing ally as a *sacrifice*.
Roll a d10 and add this value to your damage roll as necrotic damage. The *sacrifice* takes half the d10's value as necrotic damage.
You may use this a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier.
This increases to 2d10 at level 17.
## Transmute
You have learned how to take incoming magical damage and convert it into a tool for your own means.
When hit with an attack that deals magical damage, add half the damage you receive to a separate pool. When you attack on the next turn with a single-target attack or spell, add this pool to the damage inflicted.
If this damage pool is not spent on your turn, it dissipates and is lost.
## Savage Cast
You are unconcerned with the wellbeing of others while you attack. Collateral damage is the result.
When making a single-target attack with a tome or spell that inflicts damage, you may choose to do so in a way that also affects any creatures within 5 feet of the target.
If the attack on the initial target hits, all creatures within 5 feet take half the damage applied to the initial target.
You may use this ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier.
