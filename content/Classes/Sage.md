## Tome Mastery (2)
When you use a tome, roll a d4. On a 4, do not expend any tome charges.
At level 18, you do not expend any charges on a 3 or a 4.
## Cleric
Your training as a sage has given you insight into the holy magics used by healers.
You can attune to and use staffs as if you were a healer. You have three (3) staff attunement slots that are separate from tome attunement slots.
## Spell Harmony
Your understanding of magic has resulted in the ability to amplify your spells by drawing from the support of your allies.
Your spells and tomes gain a bonus to their damage rolls equal to the number of friendly creatures within a 15 foot radius of you. The friendly creature must have an intelligence score of 9 or higher for you to gain the benefit of this feature.
At level 17, this bonus doubles.
## Tomefaire
You become an expert with using tomes.
When using tomes, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls.
## Resistance Seal
Your spells become so powerful that it becomes nearly impossible to resist their effects.
When you deal damage with a spell, that damage ignores resistances (but not immunities).
Additionally, when you target a creature with a spell that would deal damage that it is vulnerable to, you gain advantage on that spell's attack roll against that creature and that creature has disadvantage on any saving throws made against the effects of your spell.
