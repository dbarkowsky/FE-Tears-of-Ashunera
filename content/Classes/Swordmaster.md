## Combat Arts
You unlock new combat arts that you can learn, listed in the [[#Swordmaster Combat Arts]] section at the end of this class's section. The Arts Known column of your class table shows you how many Combat Arts you can learn in total. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one Combat Art you know with a different one that you are able to learn.
You cannot use more than one Combat Art on the same attack. For example, if you use an Art that activates when you make a weapon attack roll, you cannot also use a second Art that activates when you hit with that attack.
### Arts Dice
Characters who use Combat Arts have Arts Dice, which are d8s. Combat Arts require Art Dice to use, and Arts Dice are expended once used. You regain all of your expended Arts Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
The Arts Dice column of your class table shows when you gain more Arts Dice. Each Combat Art specifies how many Arts Dice it uses.
### Combat Arts Save DC
You use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Art.
- Combat Arts Save DC  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
## Swordfaire
You become an expert with using Swords. When using swords, rapiers, scimitars, or similar weapons with a long bladed body, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls. This bonus doubles against creatures wielding axes.
## Supreme Astra
Your use of Combat Arts have culminated in the development of your ultimate finishing skill.
As an action, you can attack a single enemy five times. You cannot use combat arts with these attacks.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
## Killer Instinct
Your sword moves gracefully through the air, always finding the vital points of contact for maximum damage. When you roll an attack roll, treat a 19 as a critical hit as well.
This effect stacks with similar effects.
## Avoid +15
Your grace while wielding a sword becomes unmatched. Your ability to dance around the battlefield grants you superior evasion.
While you are wielding a single sword weapon and no other weapons or shields, your AC is increased by 3. You do not gain this benefit if you are shapeshifted.
