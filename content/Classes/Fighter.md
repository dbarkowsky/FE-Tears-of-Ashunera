## Local Handyman
You've helped many neighbors with various tasks that require physical labor, lending yourself to become a useful hand to have around. Commoners will happily offer you a place to rest or recuperate in exchange for your help with various chores, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them.

Anyone you've helped this way will also offer you safe haven should you need a place to hide and will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

You also gain the cantrip Mending.
## Action Surge
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long
rest before you can use it again.
## Rally Style
You adopt a particular style of rallying those around you to draw out their full potential. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
Choose one of the following rallying styles to learn:
### Rally Strength
As a bonus action, your might roar inspires your allies to fight with their full Strength. Choose a number of ally creatures up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one) that can hear see you within 15 feet. Until your next turn, each target creature gains a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to your Constitution modifier.
### Rallying Cry
As a bonus action, your words of friendship inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries. Choose a number of ally creatures up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one) that can hear and see you within 60 feet. Each target creature regains hit points equal to half your level (rounded up) + your Constitution modifier.
### Rally Resistance
As a bonus action, your bellowing cries help your allies better endure punishment. Choose a number of ally creatures up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one) that can hear
and see you within 15 feet. Until your next turn, each target creature has advantage on their next saving throw.
## Zeal
You have dedicated your fighting style to a particular weapon. It feels like an extension of your body, and you gain one of the following benefits:
### Axe Zeal
You swing your weapons with such fervor that weapon attacks score a critical hit on one more roll result. For example, on a 19 or 20 instead of just 20. This effect stacks with other similar effects.
### Brawler Zeal
When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a gauntlet weapon, you can use your
bonus action to make one more weapon attack using your unarmed strike or a gauntlet weapon.

When you deal damage with an unarmed strike or gauntlet weapon, you may use your reaction to
make one more weapon attack using your unarmed strike or a gauntlet weapon.
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Ability Score Improvement
Because of your dedication to bettering yourself, you see noticeable gains in your abilities and skills. You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. A feat may also be taken in place of this improvement.
## Additional Fighting Style
Choose a second fighting style from the following options:
### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon you are wielding with two hands, you can re-roll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.
### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
### Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d4 becomes a d6. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.
