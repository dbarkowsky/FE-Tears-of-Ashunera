## Combat Arts
Unlike soldiers who are drilled to fight in a unit or fighters who rely physical Strength, those who discipline themselves to the mastery of weapons are able to learn special skills and techniques known as Combat Arts.
The arts you can learn are listed in the [[#Myrmidon Combat Arts]] section at the end of this class's section. The Arts Known column of your class table shows you how many Combat Arts you can learn in total. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one Combat Art you know with a different
one that you are able to learn. 
You cannot use more than one Combat Art on the same attack. For example, if you use an Art that activates when you make a weapon attack roll, you cannot also use a second Art that activates when you hit with that attack.
### Arts Dice
Characters who use Combat Arts have Arts Dice, which are d8s. Combat Arts require Art Dice to use, and Arts Dice are expended once used. You regain all of your expended Arts Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
The Arts Dice column of your class table shows when you gain more Arts Dice. Each Combat Art specifies how many Arts Dice it uses.
### Combat Arts Save DC
You use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Art.
- Combat Arts Save DC  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
## Fast Movement
Your speed increases by 15 feet while you are wearing light or no armor and not wielding a Shield.
## Avoid +10
Your mastery of the sword teaches you how to gracefully dodge and parry enemy strikes without the use of a shield. While you are wielding a sword in one hand and no other weapon or shield in the other hand, your AC is increased by 2.
You do not gain this benefit if you are shapeshifted.
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Vantage
Your reflexes are so well honed that you can strike at an enemy during the opening they make when they attempt to strike at you.
When a creature within your reach attacks you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature. Make your attack before the creature makes their attack.
## Duelist's Blow
You've trained your body to strike your opponent's limbs and deter counter attacks.
A creature that you hit a melee attack against has disadvantage on all attacks against you until the start of your next turn.
## Myrmidon Combat Arts
These are the combat arts you can learn as a Myrmidon.
### Blade Throw
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 arts die to make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the finesse, light, and throw properties. Add the expended arts die to the attack's damage roll.
### Blinding Strike
When you make a melee weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one arts die to attempt to blind it with a precise strike or a surprise maneuver. If the attack hits, add the expended arts die to the attack's damage roll and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is blinded until the end of it's next turn. If it fails by 10 or more, it loses an eye.
### Blade Dancer
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 arts die to dodge incoming attacks with use graceful footwork. Roll the expended arts die. You gain a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled on melee attacks made against you until your next turn.
### Finesse Blade
When you make a melee weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one arts die to add a flourishing technique to the strike. Add the expended arts die to both the attack roll and the attack's damage roll.
### Hexblade
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one arts die to imbue magic into your strike. Add the expended arts die to the attack's damage roll. Choose between Cold, Fire, and Lightning for the damage type of this attack instead.
### Mistdancer
When you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can expend one arts die to react with a dancer's grace. Roll the expended arts die and add the number rolled to your saving throw.
### Sunder
When you make a melee weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one arts die to make the attack score a critical hit on three more roll results. For example, on a 17, 18, 19, or 20 instead of just 20. If the attack scores a critical hit, add the expended arts die to the attack's damage roll. This effect stacks with other similar effects.
### Swallow Strike
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to expend one arts die and make a swift follow up strike. Make an attack against the hit creature
as a bonus action and add the expended arts die to the attack roll.
### Sweeping Attack
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one arts die to follow through on the attack to hit an adjacent enemy. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the
original target and within your reach and make an attack against it. If the attack hits, add the expended arts die to the attack's damage roll.
### Windsweep
When you make an attack roll with your sword, you can expend one arts die to make a ranged attack as your sword swing ripples through the air. On a hit, add the expended arts die to the attack's damage roll and treat all damage as force damage.
