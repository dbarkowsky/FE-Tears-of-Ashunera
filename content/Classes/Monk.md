> When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend a number of charges up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one) to gain +1 AC per expended charge against that single attack.

## Physical Faith
Your faith has combined with your physical discipline to form a a constant barrier around yourself that can easily brush off incoming attacks.
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Constitution modifier. You do not gain this benefit if you are shapeshifted.
## Hardened Faith
Your hit points is increased by your Wisdom modifier per level.
## Spellcasting
You have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells on the Paladin Spell List. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting.
### Preparing Spells
You are able to cast any spell from the Paladin Spell List. However, you can only prepare a certain number of spells to be accessible to you at any given time. You may prepare a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your level.
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can change your list of prepared spells by spending time in meditation for 15 minutes.
### Spell Slots
The Monk table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
### Tome Proficiency
You are practiced with Light tomes.
As a Monk, you can attune to tomes and decipher the magic powers inscribed into them to cast basic spells.
There are many types of tomes, but Monks start their journey with the very basics of Light magic. There are more powerful tomes with sophisticated divine magics within, but they require great mastery of magic to be deciphered and understood. This is represented by a tome's level requirements.
All tomes have a number of charges that they can store as magic to be expelled. A tome recovers all of it's charges after spending 8 hours in the presence of the caster attuned to it. As an action, a caster can navigate the magic powers stored within a tome to activate it's effects, expending charges of the tome's power in the process.
Tomes must be attuned to, and this number is separate from a character's general attunement limit. See the Tome Attunements column in the Monk table for the number of tomes you can be attuned to at once.
## Divine Smite
When you hit a creature with a melee attack using Strength, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead, monstrosity or a fiend.
## Turn the Terrors
You can use an action to raise your staff and speak a prayer to the goddess to censure the terrors. Each fiend, monstrosity or undead that can see or hear you within 45 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
## Extended Barrier
Your control of the defensive magic in your Monk Staff improves enough to allow you to extend it's protection to your allies.
As a bonus action, you can expend a number of charges up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one) of your Hardened Monk Staff to grant +1 AC per expended charge to you and a single target creature within 30 feet of you.
This effect lasts until you begin your next turn.
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Destroy Terrors
When an fiend, monstrosity or undead fails its saving throw against your Turn the Terrors feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Terrors table.

| Character Level | Destroys Terrors of CR |
| :-------------: | :--------------------: |
|       7th       |      1/2 or lower      |
|       9th       |       1 or lower       |
|      11th       |       2 or lower       |
|      14th       |       3 or lower       |
|      17th       |       4 or lower       |
## Fists of Fury
When making an attack using unarmed strikes or gauntlets, you may follow up that attack with an offhand gauntlet strike that does half damage. Attack rolls are treated as normal, but the offhand attack does not benefit from your Strength. If you can attack more than once per turn, this ability applies each time.
## Aura of Courage
You have braved the battlefield enough to always radiate an aura of courage. You and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. A creature that is already frightened is unaffected by your aura.
