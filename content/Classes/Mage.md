## Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have discovered the knowledge of spellcasting, being able to learn spells on the Wizard Spell List. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting.
### Spell Slots
The Mage table shows how many spell slots you gain at each level to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, If you know the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot.
### Spells Known
You know five 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Mage table shows when you learn more wizard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
Additionally, when you gain a level, you can choose one of the wizard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
### Cantrips
You know four cantrips of your choice from the Wizard Cantrip List.
## Fiendish Blow
Your study of anima magic has granted you an instinctual command over them. You can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage rolls of spells and tome magic you cast.
## Magic Discipline
You adopt a particular discipline of magic as your specialty. Depending on the focus of your arcane studies, choose one of the following styles to learn:
### Controlled Discipline
Your study of spells has manifested the ability to shape the elements you conjure through mental imagery, allowing you to create pockets of safety within the effects of your larger spells.
When you cast an spell that affects more than one creature that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one) to remain untouched by your spell. The chosen creatures suffer no damage nor negative effects from your spell.
### Defensive Discipline
Your study of spells has manifested the ability to weave magic around yourself for protection, creating a magical ward on yourself that can absorb damage.
You always have an Defensive Ward around you. The ward has a hit point maximum equal to twice your level + your Wisdom modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.
Whenever you cast a spell that would target yourself or a willing creature, your Defensive Ward gains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot used. At the end of a long rest, your abjuration ward gains a number of hit points equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier.
### Efficient Discipline
Your study of spells has manifested the ability to recapture the energy spent casting your spells.
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, or when you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can use your action end the spell prematurely or end your concentration to recover the spell slot spent to cast the spell. 
The level of the recovered spell slot cannot exceed your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one).
## Focus
Those around you are simply distractions from your study, and you perform better without their interference.
When you have no allies or opponents within 15 feet of yourself, you gain +2 to spell attack rolls and +1 to your spell save DC.
## Tome Mastery
You've read your anima tomes so frequently that you've practically memorized their contents, allowing you to activate an anima tome's magic much more quickly.
You can activate a tome's magic as a bonus action if the tome's Casting Time is normally 1 Action and it's Duration is Instantaneous.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
## Flare
You learn a powerful technique for amplifying your anima magic with light magic. When you cast a spell that requires it's targets to make a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on each creature's saving throw. For each creature that fails their save, you restore 1d10 hit points.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
