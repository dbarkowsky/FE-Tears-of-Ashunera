## Fletching
As you've dedicated yourself to the bow, so to have you learned to craft the ammunition required for archery.
If you have access to a shop where you can purchase the necessary materials, you can attempt to craft any Basic Arrows during a short or long rest. See the [[Weapons#Arrows|Arrows]] page for details.
On a failure, none of the arrows are unusable and the materials are wasted.
## Spellcasting
Spending your time traversing and understanding the wilderness, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells on the Ranger Spell List. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting.
### Spell Slots
The Archer table shows how many spell slots you gain at each level to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.
### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Archer table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
Additionally, when you gain a level, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature.
You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 
- Spell Save DC  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
- Spell attack modifier  =  your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
## Archery Style
You adopt a particular style of archery techniques as your specialty. Depending on the type of training you focus on, choose one of the following styles to learn:
### Twined Archery
You learn to knock multiple arrows with a single draw. On your first ranged weapon attack each turn, you may target two creatures that is within 5 feet of each other instead of just one creature. Roll your attack against each creature separately.
### Hurtful Archery
You learn to concentrate on targeting a creature's exposed wounds with your arrows.
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, it takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus if it is missing any of its hit points.
### Slaying Archery
You learn how to slay giant monsters with precise bow strikes. You gain advantage on ranged weapon attacks against large or larger creatures.
You can forgo the advantage on a ranged weapon attack against a large or larger creature to gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to half your level (rounded up).
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Warding Arrow
You have combined your archery skills with your knowledge of magic to design a arrow enchantment meant for thwarting other spellcasters. When you see a creature casting a spell within 120 feet of you, you can use your reaction to try and foil their spellcasting by launching a imbued arrow towards their general vicinity.
The target creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or their spell fails and has no effect.
If the spell being cast is of 3rd level or higher, the target creature has advantage on the saving throw.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
## Greater Fletching
You learn to craft Specialized Arrows for taking down your foes. See the [[Weapons#Arrows|Arrows]] page for more details on each arrow.
