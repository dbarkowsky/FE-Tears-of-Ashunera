> [!NOTE] Controlling a Mount
> You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It can act either before or after you.
> 
> It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it, given that it has not already acted that turn.
> PHB, pg. 198

> [!NOTE] Mounting and Dismounting
> Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.
> 
> If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
> 
> If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
> PHB, pg. 198

## Courser
Having shown a natural affinity with horses and mounted combat, you have been given a Courser as your companion. Taking care of it is your responsibility and duty. Should your Courser die, you will need to spend 800 gp to purchase and outfit a replacement.

## Skilled Rider
You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if youâ€™re not incapacitated.
Additionally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
## Canto
Your command of your mount grants you the ability to easily reposition yourself on the battlefield.
After you've taken your action, you can use your reaction to grant your mount an additional 30 foot of movement. A creature that you or your mount have dealt damage to on your turn has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you and your mount until the end of your turn.
## Breathing Style
You adopt a particular style of breathing to regulate your pulse and amplify your survival instincts.
Depending on the adventures you've braved, choose one of the following styles to learn:
### Darting Breath
You learn how to grant yourself a burst of speed by taking a deep breath and using it to push yourself to your full potential.
As a bonus action, you can attack an opponent and then move up to your movement speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
### Steady Breath
You learn how to regulate your breathing with calming focus, improving your accuracy by steadying your movement.
As a bonus action, if have not moved yet this turn, you can opt to not move in order to grant yourself a +3 bonus to attack rolls.
### Warding Breath
You learn how to breath with a consistent pace when fending off magical attacks.
As a bonus action, you can grant yourself advantage on saving throws against spells or other harmful magical effects until your next turn.
## Gauntlet Breaker
You take advantage of opponents armed with nothing but their hands.
When attacking a foe wielding gauntlets, add +2 to your attack and damage rolls.
## Close Counter
You are no longer at disadvantage when making ranged attacks at opponents within 5 feet.
## Bow Buster
You see archers as nothing more than stationary targets, making them easier to hit.
Add +2 to your attack roll when targeting an opponent wielding a bow.
Conversely, when an opponent with a bow rolls to attack you, add +2 to your AC.
## Waning Shot
Your shots target the critical vitals on your opponent, making it more difficult for them to strike back.
When you use this ability and your attack hits the opponent, that opponent has disadvantage on attack rolls for the next minute and their speed is reduced to 10 feet.
You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier per long rest.
