You adopt a peculiar style of oaths to follow to guide you through your life, through the good and the bad. Depending on your beliefs, choose one of the following oaths to uphold and sets of spells to learn.

You learn the Detect Magic, Identify, Detect Thoughts, See Invisibility, and Clairvoyance spells.
At level 13, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings.
If you spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, you will receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can learn the identity of an object's last owner or when it was last used, you can see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity, particularly those that involve powerful emotions.
### Oath of Plenty

When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to choose a number of other friendly creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). Distribute the damage taken between the original target and the chosen creatures (rounded down to a minimum of one). The distributed damage retains it's original damage type.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest or short rest.
### Oath of Protection
You pledge to uphold an oath of Protection, vowing to be a shield for the weak and broken.
You learn the Sanctuary, Mage Armor, Warding Bond, Arcane Lock, and Non-detection spells.
At level 13, your aura of courage protects your allies from harm, improving their abilities to fend off danger.
You and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you gain a bonus to all saving throws equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
## Axefaire
You become an expert with using Axes.
When using Axes, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls. This bonus doubles against creatures wielding lances.
