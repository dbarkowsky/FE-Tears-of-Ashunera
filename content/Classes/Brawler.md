## Spellcasting
This class does not come with additional spellcasting features, but if you promoted from the [[Monk]] class, you retain your ability to use tomes, your monk staff, and Paladin spells. The number of spells you can prepare and the associated spell slots do not increase.
## Brawling Prowess
While you are unarmed, using natural melee weapons, or using gauntlets, you have advantage on your grapple rolls.
Additionally, when you successfully grapple an opponent, any damage you deal to them with an attack will deal an extra 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage.
## Fistfaire
You become an expert at fighting with your fists.
While you are unarmed, using natural melee weapons, or using gauntlets, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls. This bonus doubles against creatures you are grappling.
## Extra Attack (2)
You can attack three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Tomebreaker
For you, the movements of spellcasters are slow and predictable when compared to your punches.
If an opponent you attack with unarmed strikes or gauntlets is wielding a tome or staff, add +2 to attack and damage rolls. If they are affected by a magical effect that grants additional AC, ignore that and calculate their AC without it.
## Quick Riposte
Your lightning-fast reflexes take advantage of an opponent's temporary lapse in focus.
If an opponent within your melee attack range makes an attack with a bow or tome, uses a staff, or casts a spell, make an opportunity attack against them.
This attack does not consume your reaction for the round, and you do not have to be the target of the opponent's action.
