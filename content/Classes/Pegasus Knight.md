## Pegasus
Your pegasus has grown into its full adult form. Taking care of it is your responsibility and duty. Should your pegasus die, you will need to spend 3500 gp to purchase and outfit a replacement.
## Warding Blow
The mythical nature of the pegasus, combined with your devotion to your deity, provides you with a barrier against magical attacks. When you successfully make an attack against an opponent, you may imbue yourself and your mount with temporary resistance. The next time your receive damage from a spell, tome, or staff, you may reduce the damage to half.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
## Lancefaire
You become an expert with using Lances. When using lances, spears, or similar weapons with a
polearm, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls. This bonus doubles against creatures wielding swords.
## Extra Attack (2)
You can attack three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Emissary of Peace
Your very presence not only calms others, it radiates the divine energies of the goddess herself as one of her appointed knights.
You and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you are immune to disease and poison while you are conscious. A creature that is already afflicted with disease or poison will have advantage on any checks made to recover from it's effects while within your presence.
## Stun
Your prayers to the goddess allow you to deliver her divine judgment through your lance.
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can call upon the goddess to sunder the target creature. The target creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 12 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
