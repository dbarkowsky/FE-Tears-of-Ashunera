## Combat Arts
You unlock new combat arts that you can learn, listed in the [[#Heroic Combat Arts]] section at the end of this class's section. The Arts Known column of your class table shows you how many Combat Arts you can learn in total. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one Combat Art you know
with a different one that you are able to learn.
You cannot use more than one Combat Art on the same attack. For example, if you use an Art that activates when you make a weapon attack roll, you cannot also use a second Art that activates when you hit with that attack.
### Arts Dice
Characters who use Combat Arts have Arts Dice, which are d8s. Combat Arts require Art Dice to use, and Arts Dice are expended once used. You regain all of your expended Arts Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
The Arts Dice column of your class table shows when you gain more Arts Dice. Each Combat Art specifies how many Arts Dice it uses.
### Combat Arts Save DC
You use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Art.
- Combat Arts Save DC  =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
## Triangle Adept
You become an expert with all sorts of weapons, allowing you to adapt your fighting style to always maintain an advantage over your opponent.
You gain a +2 bonus to your attack rolls when using a sword against creatures wielding axes, using an axe against creatures wielding lances, or using a lance against creatures wielding swords.
## Radiant Aether
Your use of Combat Arts have culminated in the development of your ultimate finishing skill.
As an action, you can attack a single enemy twice. For these attacks, the target creature's AC is treated as if it was 10, and you restore health equal to the amount of damage dealt. You cannot use combat arts with these attacks.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
## Folksong Hero
Your heroic feats have turned you into a local legend. Bards have written songs of you that are popular at taverns across the continent.
Unless you take actions to harm them, people who are not hostile to you and have heard of you are always actively friendly to you. You can find comfortable lodging in pretty much any populated area for free or at significant discounts.
## Heroic Arts Die
Your mastery of Combat Arts has turned them into fearsome techniques that are the stuff of legends.
Your arts die changes from a 1d8 to a 1d12. Additionally, when you roll a 1 or 2 on an arts die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.
## Heroic Combat Arts
These are the combat arts you can learn as a Hero.
### Aether
When you make a melee weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend three arts dice call upon the heavens to lend you Strength. Add the expended arts dice to the attack roll. If the attack hits, roll the expended arts dice again and regain hit points equal to the roll result.
### Draining Blow
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend two arts dice to add a draining spell to your strike. Roll the expended arts dice and regain hit points equal to the roll result.

turn. This effect can stack.
### Soulblade
