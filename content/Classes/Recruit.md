## Rank and File
You've been drilled to fight shoulder to shoulder with your allies, learning to strike an enemy when it is distracted in order to turn a numerical advantage into victory against foes
larger and stronger than yourself. 

You have advantage on melee attack rolls against a
creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the
creature. The ally creature must not be Incapacitated and
have an Intelligence of 7 or higher.
## Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

| Style                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Defense               | While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Dueling               | When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. You gain this benefit even when holding a shield.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Great Weapon Fighting | When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.                                                               |
| Protection            | When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Unarmed Fighting      | Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d4 becomes a d6. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack. |
## Ability Score Improvement
When your character reaches the 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
