## Great Shield
You gain mastery of heavy armor and shields.
While you are wearing heavy armor and wielding a shield, you have +2 AC against non-magical ranged attacks.
Additionally, creatures directly behind you are considered to be behind three-quarters cover.
## Armored Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting with heavy armor. Depending on your training, choose one of the following fighter styles to learn:
### Wary Fighter
You fight patiently, keeping your guard up against all potential threats.
When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature until your next turn.
### Bold Fighter
You fight boldly, throwing yourself at your enemy while trusting in your armor to keep you safe.
When you make a melee attack and miss, you can use your reaction to make the same attack again against the same target.
### Vengeful Fighter
You fight spitefully, intent on repaying your enemies twofold for any harm they do to you.
When a creature targets you with an attack, you gain a +5 bonus to your next one damage roll against that creature. This effect does not stack.
## Swap
You are able to smoothly move between your allies and your enemies to protect them from harm.
When an ally creature within 5 feet of you is attacked, before the creature makes it's attack roll, you can use your reaction to swap places with that ally creature and redirect the attack towards you instead. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
## Weight -50
You can carry an additional 50 lbs before becoming encumbered.
## Heavy Armor Mastery
While you are wearing heavy armor and wielding a shield, you are resistant to non-magical
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 
## Pavise
Your defensive capabilities are blessed by the dragon gods themselves. Whenever you would take any amount of damage from an attack or other effect, you can completely ignore that damage instead.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
