## Death Blow
Your wild attacks tap into your instincts and their power is greatly enhanced by your ferocity.
Whenever you hit a creature with an attack that you had advantage on, you gain a +3 bonus to that attack's damage roll.
## Gamble
Your reckless nature allows you take even greater risks for brutal reward.
Whenever you choose to attack recklessly, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, it is automatically considered a critical hit.
## Savage Style
You adopt a particular style of savagery in your attacks. Depending on your honed instincts, choose one of the following rage styles to learn:
### Empowered Savagery
Your survival instincts enhance the power of your reckless attacks.
Whenever you choose to attack savagely, you gain a bonus to your damage rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier until your next turn.
### Impervious Savagery
Your rage hardens your muscles and reflexes, perfecting your natural defenses.
Whenever you choose to attack savagely, you gain AC equal to your Wisdom modifier.
### Mindless Savagery
You let your rage take over your mind, relying on instincts only.
Whenever you choose to attack savagely, you have advantage on all Wisdom saving throws and cannot be frightened until your next turn.
## Anchor
If you roll less than a 10 on any Constitution or Strength ability check or saving throw, your roll becomes a 10 instead.
## Wrath
Your fury knows no bounds, especially when its in retaliation to an attack. Once attacked by an enemy, any attack from you that targets that enemy carries the weight of your wrath. On a critical hit, add two additional damage dice to your damage rolls.
