> [!NOTE] Controlling a Mount
> You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It can act either before or after you.
> 
> It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it, given that it has not already acted that turn.
> PHB, pg. 198

> [!NOTE] Mounting and Dismounting
> Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.
> 
> If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
> 
> If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
> PHB, pg. 198

![[Destrier (Horse).png]]
## Destrier
Your companion has grown into a strong and fearless mount. Taking care of it is your responsibility and duty. Should your Destrier die, you will need to spend 1800 gp to purchase and outfit a replacement.
## Weaponfaire
You've become an expert with your chosen weapon. Choose a weapon type with which you are proficient. When using this weapon type, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls. This bonus doubles depending on the weapon you and your opponent wield. See the table below for these match ups.

| You   | Opponent            |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| Sword | Axe                 |
| Axe   | Lance               |
| Lance | Sword               |

## Warding Maneuver
You learn to fend off strikes directed at your mount or adjacent allies.
If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to grant a +5 AC bonus to the target of the attack until your next turn, potentially causing the attack to miss.
## Absolve
Your riding skills have been trained to perfection.
Your mount has +10 on Dexterity saving throws.
## Aegis
While you are mounted, you can give yourself, your mount, and a rescued creature on your mount advantage on a saving throw against a single spell or other magical effect. If the effect would deal half damage on a successful save, it instead deals no damage, and only half damage on a failed save.
If the effect called for a Dexterity saving throw and your mount succeeds on it, any creatures riding the mount automatically succeed on the saving throw as well.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
## Sol
You learn to use holy powers to convert the energy of your strikes into a protective barrier.
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can change the damage type to Radiant and gain temporary hit points twice the damage dealt.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
