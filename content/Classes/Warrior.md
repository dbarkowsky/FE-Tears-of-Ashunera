## Axefaire
You become an expert with using Axes.
When using [[Weapons#Axes|Axes]], you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls. This bonus doubles against creatures wielding lances.
## Defiant Style
You adopt a peculiar style of defiance when you pushed to the brink. Depending on your fundamentals, choose one of the following defiant styles to learn:
### Defiant Strength
Your defiance refuses to let you be outmatched in a contest of Strength.
While you have no more than half of your hit points left, you gain a +2 bonus to your damage rolls and you have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.
### Defiant Defense
Your defiance refuses to let you be knocked out in combat.
While you have no more than half of your hit points left, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws.
### Defiant Speed
Your defiance refuses to let you be pinned down. 
While you have no more than half of your hit points left, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
## Life and Death
You may choose to start combat encounters with half of your hit points. If you do, you also gain temporary hit points equal to three times your Constitution modifier.
## Extra Attack (2)
You can attack three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Counter
When receiving damage from an opponent that does not bring you to 0 hit points, you may lash out in retaliation using your reaction, turning the force of the opponent's blow against them. Providing that the opponent is in melee range and you are currently holding a melee weapon, make an attack roll and, on a hit, the enemy receives half their original damage in return. You may use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
## Survivor
You attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, unless you are incapacitated, you gain temporary hit points equal to 10 + three times your Constitution modifier.
