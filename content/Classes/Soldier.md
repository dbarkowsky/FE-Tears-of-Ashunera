## Military Armory
Your appearance as a member of the military gives you preferential treatment from blacksmiths and armourers. You can purchase weapons and armor with a 10% discount.
## Military Presence
People can immediately tell you are a trained soldier of the military. In general, citizens of peaceful territories will respect you, and those within your own borders will listen to your requests within reason. You can report to local military leadership to request an audience or find work without difficulty.
## Shield Bash
Your army training has taught you ways to use your shield both for offense as well as defense.
While equipped with a shield, you can use a bonus action to bash a creature with your shield and knock them prone.
If the target creature is no more than one size larger than you and within your reach, it must succeed a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or fall prone and be pushed up to 10 feet away from you.
## Shove
With your powerful shield arm, you are able to shove an ally out of harms way or help give them a boost of speed. While equipped with a shield, you can use a bonus action to shove a
willing creature that is no more than one size larger than you and within your reach up to 15 feet in a direction away from you. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
## Military Training Style
You adopt a particular style of military tactics as your specialty. Depending on the type of regiment you were in and training you received, choose one of the following styles to learn:
### Formation Training
You have been drilled to fight optimally while in a formation. While there is at least 2 ally creatures within 15 feet of you that you can see, you gain +1 to all weapon attack and damage rolls. The ally creatures must not be Incapacitated and have an Intelligence of 7 or higher.
### Natural Cover Training
You have been drilled to fight while taking advantage of rough terrain and natural coverings. You treat half cover as three quarters cover, and three quarters cover as total cover. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against creatures you have cover from.
### Shield Wall Training
You have been drilled to fight shoulder to shoulder with fellow soldiers and shield bearers. While there is at least 1 ally creature within 5 feet of you that is equipped with a shield, then any b bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage that you take is reduced by 3. The ally creature must not be Incapacitated and have an Intelligence of 7 or higher.
## Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
## Luna
You learn to focus your power into the tip of your weapon in order to pierce through your opponent's armor.
When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can treat the target creature's AC as if it was 10.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
## Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target other than yourself that is within 5 feet of you with an attack dealing bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield to use this reaction.
### Protection
When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see makes an attack, you can use your reaction to shove your shield towards them and impose disadvantage on their attack roll. You must be wielding a shield to use this reaction.
### Tunnel Fighter
You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.
