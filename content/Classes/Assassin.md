## Sneak Attack
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction.
Once per turn, you can deal extra damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
The amount of extra damage is show in the Sneak Attack column of the Assassin table, and increases as you gain levels in this class. If you already had Sneak Attack as a Rogue, this feature adds the amount of extra damage to it, it does not give you a second Sneak Attack each turn.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
## Daggerfaire
You become an expert with using Daggers. 
When using daggers, short swords, or similar weapons that have both the Finesse and Light properties, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls.
## Killing Style
You adopt a peculiar style of assassination techniques. Depending on your preference, choose one of the following killing styles to learn:
### Elusive Killer
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you.
While you have taken no damage, no attack roll can have advantage against you.
### Charming Killer
You prefer to operate in plain sight, striking at an enemy when they least expect it.
While you have taken no damage, you may perform a melee weapon attack against a creature that is not hostile towards you. This attack cannot miss, applies your Sneak Attack damage, and is automatically a critical hit.
### Sadistic Killer
The act of killing has begun to bring you satisfaction in ways you never expected.
When you deal the killing blow against a creature, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your level.
## Critical +25
You can attempt to strike with critical precision with your attacks.
When you make a melee weapon attack roll against a creature, you may first roll a d4 die. On a 4, the attack automatically hits and is a critical attack. Otherwise, continue to perform the attack as normal.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
## Target Observation
You are able to learn details about your assassination targets to best prepare for a kill.
If you spend at least 10 minutes observing or interacting with another creature outside of combat, you learn that creature's weaknesses, resistances, and immunities if they have any. If you spend at least 1 hour, also learn if you know a piece of the creature's history or one of it's personality traits.
## Lethality
Your blades become such lethal weapons that stories of you strikes fear into those who would earn your ire.
Your attacks against a creature that has no more than half of its hit points left cannot miss.
Your attacks against a creature that has no more than a quarter of its hit points are automatically considered critical attacks.
